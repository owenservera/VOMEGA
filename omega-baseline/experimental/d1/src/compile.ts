// Interpretation → registration / draft / edit, and draft → canonical
// UseCommand (Phases C and D semantics).
//
// IMPLEMENTED here: D1-024 — the declared-capability command path (utterance →
// DraftCommand) and the fold of a draft plus its semantic edits into the
// candidate canonical UseCommand; D1-026 — the session-path READY law, which
// delegates to the one law in validate.ts (D1-005, PROVEN in bc226dc) instead
// of restating it. The `NotImplemented[D1-005]` label that used to sit on this
// file's `validation` was stale: D1-005 is DONE and its law lives in
// validate.ts; the compile-path surface is D1-026's; D1-027 — the typed
// correction, grounded by the SAME grounder as the command path and carried as
// the SAME SemanticEdit value a click produces, so typed and clicked corrections
// converge on one semantic edit path. D1-029 — the deterministic command
// identity, canonicalized over everything the command asserts except the consent
// decision. Still stubs, each still naming its owning task so a red gate says who
// owns it: registration (D1-021), interpreter trace (D1-025).
//
// Harvest disposition (OPERATING.md, "Harvest before inventing"): ADAPT, not
// reimplement. plugins/vivim-nlcl-pure supplies the lexer (so words inside a
// quoted payload can never retarget) and `ground` (explicit-target ranking,
// thresholds and ambiguity preservation, unchanged). `interpret()` itself was
// assayed and REJECTED at this level: it takes its frames from
// `framesForWorld(world)`, which mints a one-slot generic frame for any op
// outside its own default set — against a D1-projected WorldModel it returns
// `surface.assist` for the canonical journey phrase and `unknown` for "add my
// Claude work account", so it cannot carry D1's phrase surface. The frame layer
// below is therefore D1's own, and it never invents structure: required fields,
// consequence class and evidence class are read from declarations/*.capability.json;
// authority is NOT — it is read from the World (`world.authority[capability]`), as are
// the identity/route records. `consequence.to` is likewise not the declared
// `decl.consequence.to` (which names a semantic route and is never read): it is the
// chosen provider, resolved here.
// Nothing in this file is authority.
